# PgOutput2Json library for .NET Core
The PgOutput2Json library for .NET Core uses PostgreSQL logical replication to push changes, as JSON messages, from database tables to a message broker, such as RabbitMq (implemented) or Redis (todo). 

Logical replication is a means to stream messages generated by PostgreSQL [logical decoding plugins](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding.html) to a client. `pgoutput` is the standard logical decoding output plug-in in PostgreSQL 10+. It is maintained by the PostgreSQL community, and used by PostgreSQL itself for logical replication. This plug-in is always present so no additional libraries need to be installed. 

The PgOutput2Json library converts `pgoutput` messages to JSON format which can be used by any .NET Core application. One example of such application is PgOutput2Json.RabbitMq library which forwards these JSON messages to RabbitMQ server. 

⚠️ **PgOutput2Json is in early stages of development. Use at your own risk.**  
⚠️ **Npgsql is used for connecting to PostgreSQL. Replication support is new in Npgsql and is considered a bit experimental.** 

## Quick Start

### Setup postgresql.conf

First set the configuration options in `postgresql.conf`:
```
wal_level = logical
```
The other required settings have default values that are sufficient for a basic setup. **PostgreSQL must be restarted after this change**.

### Create a user that will be used to start the replication
Login to PostgreSQL with privileges to create users, and execute: 
```
CREATE USER pgoutput2json WITH
	PASSWORD '_your_password_here_'
	REPLICATION;
```
If you will be connecting to the PostgreSQL with this user, from a different machine (non-local connection), don't forget to modify `pg_hba.conf`. If `pg_hba.conf` is modified, you have to SIGHUP the server for the changes to take effect, run `pg_ctl reload`, or execute `SELECT pg_reload_conf()`.

### Create publication
Connect to the database that holds the tables you want to track, and create a publication that specifies the tables and actions for publishing:
```
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication
    FOR TABLE my_table1, my_table2
    WITH (publish = 'insert, update, delete, truncate');
```

### Create replication slot
In the same database, create a replication slot, which will hold the state of the replication stream:
```
SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_slot', 'pgoutput');
```
Make sure you specify `pgoutput` as a second parameter. If your application goes down, the slot persistently records the last data streamed to it, and allows resuming the application at the point where it left off.

⚠️ **Do not forget to drop the slot when you are done testing the Pgoutput2Json library. Otherwise PostgreSQL may not be able to remove/recycle WAL files. Use: `SELECT * FROM pg_drop_replication_slot('my_slot');`**
