# PgOutput2Json library for .NET Core
The PgOutput2Json library for .NET Core uses PostgreSQL logical replication to push changes, as JSON messages, from database tables to a message broker, such as RabbitMq (implemented) or Redis (todo). 

Logical replication is a means to stream messages generated by PostgreSQL [logical decoding plugins](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding.html) to a client. `pgoutput` is the standard logical decoding output plug-in in PostgreSQL 10+. It is maintained by the PostgreSQL community, and used by PostgreSQL itself for logical replication. This plug-in is always present so no additional libraries need to be installed. 

The PgOutput2Json library converts `pgoutput` messages to JSON format which can be used by any .NET Core application. One example of such application is PgOutput2Json.RabbitMq library which forwards these JSON messages to RabbitMQ server. 

⚠️ **PgOutput2Json is in early stages of development. Use at your own risk.**  
⚠️ **Npgsql is used for connecting to PostgreSQL. Replication support is new in Npgsql and is considered a bit experimental.**
